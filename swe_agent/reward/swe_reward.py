SWE Agent Reward Function

Computes reward based on patch correctness:
1. Simple mode: Compare generated patch with expected_patch
2. SWE-bench mode: Run test cases to verify patch

Reward levels:
- Fully correct: 1.0
- Partially correct: 0.5
- Generated valid patch but incorrect: 0.1
- Failed to generate patch: 0.0
