## Contributing
### Recipe Folder Structure
All recipe should follow the following structure:
- `README.md`: recipe description
- `code`: recipe code
- `script`: reproducible training script

Specifically, `README.md` should contain following sections:
- Installation: which verl version is required for this recipe?
```
# release version
pip install verl==0.6.0

# dev version
pip install verl@git+https://github.com/volcengine/verl.git@313dfdb2199124a37189e32e6d4a6c654379f2d4
```
- Training: how to train
- Evaluation: performance metrics
- Citation: paper, notion, blog, etc.

### Code Linting and Formatting
We rely on pre-commit to keep our code consistent. To set it up:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
# for staged changes
pre-commit run
# for all files in the repo
pre-commit run --all-files
# run a specific hook with pre-commit
# pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --color=always <hood-id>
pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --color=always ruff
pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --color=always autogen-trainer-cfg
```
